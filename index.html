                        <h2>Really old TV</h2>
                        <p>
                            Early electronic television sets were large and bulky, 
                            with analog circuits made of vacuum tubes. 
                            As an example, the RCA CT-100 color TV set used 36 vacuum tubes. 
                            Following the invention of the first working transistor at Bell Labs, Sony
                            founder Masaru Ibuka predicted in 1952 that the transition to electronic circuits 
                            made of transistors would lead to smaller and more portable television sets.
                            By the late 1960s and early 1970s, color television had come into wide use. 
                            In Britain, BBC1, BBC2 and ITV were regularly broadcasting in colour by 1969.

                        <p>
                            A joystick, sometimes called a flight stick, is an input device consisting of a stick 
                            that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. 
                            A joystick, also known as the control column, is the principal control device in the cockpit 
                            of many civilian and military aircraft, either as a centre stick or side-stick. It often has 
                            supplementary switches to control various aspects of the aircraft's flight.
                            Joysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more push-buttons whose
                            state can also be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video 
                            game consoles is the analog stick. Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, 
                            trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles, wheelchairs, surveillance cameras, and zero turning radius 
                            lawn mowers.

                            The compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by 
                            Philips and Sony to store and play digital audio recordings. In August 1982, the first compact 
                            disc was manufactured. It was then released in October 1982 in Japan and branded as Digital 
                            Audio Compact Disc.
                            The format was later adapted (as CD-ROM) for general-purpose data storage. Several other formats 
                            were further derived, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media 
                            (CD-RW), Video CD (VCD), Super Video CD (SVCD), Photo CD, Picture CD, Compact Disc-Interactive 
                            (CD-i) and Enhanced Music CD.
